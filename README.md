## General info
This is a high school project which mainly focus on how to develop deep learning model and adapt the model to predict PM2.5 concentration. We used meteorological data an previous day PM2.5 concentration as input for the model. The data is collected by Meteorological Department and Pollution Control Department. The model we use is a feed-forward neural network with 4-fold validation.
